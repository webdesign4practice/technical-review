  <p> The Mars orbiter mission(MOM) also known as "Mangalyaan" is a Mars-craft orbiting Mars since 24 september 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation(ISRO). It's India's first interplanatory mission and made ISRO as fourth space agency who can reach Mars. It made India as the first nation in the world to reach Mars on it's first attempt. </p>

  <p> The primary objective of the mission is to develop the technology required for designing, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission. MOM explore and observe Mars surface features, morphology, mineralogy, and the Martine atmosphere. Further, a specific search for methane in the Martine atmosphere will provide information about the possibility or the past existance of life on the planet. </p>

  <p> MOM was launched aboard PSLV C-25,which was an XL varient of the PSLV, one of world's most reliable launch vehicles. The XL varient was earlier used to launch Chandrayaan(2008), GSAT-12(2011) and RISAT-1(2012). The MOM spacecraft carries 850 kg of fuel and 5 science payloads. The orbiter is being tracked by the Indian Deep Space Network(IDSN). The Mars mission was envisaged as a rendezvous problem, wherein the Mars orbiter is manoeuvred into a departure hyperbolic trajectory, escapes the SOI of Earth and therefore enters the SOI of Mars. </p>

  <p> Mangalyaan mission successfully completed five years of orbiting Mars on 24 September 2019. The launch vehical, spacecraft and ground segment was built at a cost Rs.450 crore, which astonished the whole world. In the past years, the Mars orbiter has sent thousands of pictures of the planet and this has helped ISRO prepare a Martine Atlas. The orbiter is the only Martine artificial satellite that has captured the full disc of Mars in one view frame. It has also captured Phobos and Deimos, the two moons of Mars, from a short distance.</p>
